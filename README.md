# IDENTIFICATION OF HAND MOVEMENT STAGES FOR BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE USING MACHINE LEARNING
In this thesis a deep learning based control algorithm for a fully functional, real-time
prosthetic limb is presented to provide motor rehabilitation and restoration. The proposed scheme detects six different events related to hand movement during a task of grasping and lifting an object, using electroencephalography (EEG). The six events
represent six different stages of a sequence of hand movements (hand starts moving,
starts lifting the object, etc.). This method mainly aims at increasing the classification
performance of motor imagery electroencephalography by incorporating Convolutional
Neural Network based learning approaches on BCI applications.
